                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-2"><strong>PART III.  HISTORY</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The rapid increase of student population in Marikina City and the continuous congestion of the existing secondary schools, the City Mayor Hon. Marides C. Fernando initiated the establishment of Fortune High School.
<br><br>The school building was built in a vacant lot situated long Santan St., and located right just beside Fortune Elementary School.
<br><br>In May 2007, the school was made as an annex of Marikina Heights High School through the efforts of Dr. Flordeliza R. Mayari, the Schools Division Superintendent.
<br><br>The operation of the school started in June 20017, headed by the very dynamic Officer-In-Charge, <strong>MR. WILFREDO S. JABAL</strong>, who then faced a lot of challenges as the school was just starting. With 17 contractual teachers to teach a number of 1,030 students, they were able to start providing a quality education.
<br><br>Fortune High School, on its early operation as an annex school has proven its worth when it was chosen as the host school for the observation of the former President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on January 1, 2008.
<br><br>The whole school year of 2007 – 2008 was a bit successful. Then, in June 2008, <strong>DR. LYDIA B. TIMOTEO</strong>, Principal III, took over to manage the school. Known for her accuracy, diligence and initiative in working out school’s status, Fortune High School was put to her trust.
<br><br>As Dr. Lydia B. Timoteo moved to Fortune High school, permanent teachers from Marikina Heights High School were also transferred as one of the requirements of becoming an independent school. In just some time, the school attained its independence on August 12, 2008 through the collaboration of the local government, parents, teachers, and students for whom the building is wholeheartedly dedicated.
<br><br>The school, young as it is, has not only proven its competitiveness, socially and academically through attending and winning some school contest and events but also through participating in contest held by the city. This was best proven during the Rehiyon-Rehiyon 2009 when Barangay Fortune and the school itself reigned as the champion on both the street dancing and dance participation.
<br><br>The leadership of Dr. Lydia B. Timoteo has helped a lot with regards to the school’s physical facilities and staff development. The school was given 19 permanent items in addition to the nine items transferred to the school.
<br><br>Driven by strong desire toward educational competence, Dr. Eduardo V. Lopez, Schools Division Superintendent, issued a reassignment of principals effective July 5, 2010. Thus, fortune High school has another leader in the name of<strong> MRS. NELLY C. CONDE</strong>, the principal of Tańong High School. Her legacy and achievements in Tańong High School will also be shared here in Fortune High School. She has already started some innovations for the improvement of the school particularly the academic performance of the students.
<br><br>With the transition of a new Schools Division Superintendent, Dr. Elizabeth E. Quesada, the foundation of Fortune High School had matched up its current improvements and standards. In a matter of time, Fortune High school had indeed showed exemplary performance in various District. Division and even Regional Competitions.
<br><br>Just recently, another transition occurred as Mrs. Nelly C. Conde went back to Tañong High School and Fortune High School welcomed its former school administrator, <strong>DR. LYDIA B. TIMOTEO</strong>. She is more than willing to regain her former plans for the holistic development of Fortune High School. She has been very active in strengthening the academic performance of students especially in the light of the National Achievement Test.
<br><br>Listed below are the principals who gave prestige to Fortune High School.
<br>
<br>Mr. Wilfredo S. Jabal 2002-2008
<br>Dr. Lydia B. Timoteo 2008 – 2010
<br>Mrs. Nelly C. Conde 2010 – 2013

<br><br><strong>4. Resource Mobilization/Public Expenditure
<br></strong><br>The educational services of the school, being a government academic institution had been chiefly by the national government through the MOOE Fund. Other financial needs of the school for its operational requirement had been provided by and/or taken from Local Government Units (City Government of Marikina, Barangay Council), Local School Board (FHS Faculty Club), FHS Consumer Cooperative funds donations, and PTA.
